    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "Naive Bayes would be an appriopriate machine learning algorithm for this problem. Some real world applications include being used to identify spam and non spam emails. The strength of the model is that it only requires a small amount of training data to be able to estimate necessary parameters for classification. The weakness of the model is that the assumption of independence is mostly wrong and usually gives a low accuracy score. For this dataset, there exists a large quantity of data that is also labeled. Furthermore, we do not know that if the other features in the dataset are independent from each other. Since the objective of this problem is to only classify a certain income level, Naive Bayes classifiers are considered decent at classification but not accuracy so it can still be suitable to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second model is Support Vector machines. Some real life applications is in document classification, where it takes documents and identifies its characteristics for categorization. The advantages of using this model is that due to the model's complexity being unaffected, the SVM is ideal for learning tasks where the number of features is considered great compared to the number of training instances. The disadvantages is that, SVM methods are only binary and require all classification to be in binary to be classified. This model makes a good candidate for this problem, due to the features in the data being a large amount of data which are labeled. The model may only be effective in classifying in higher dimensions. Furthermore, the dataset has a much larger amount of datasets compared to features so overfitting should not be too concerning.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees would also be an appropriate machine learning algorithm. Some real world applications include diagnosis for cancer. Certain features of cancers can be identified and the decision tree grows as more traits are classified. The strength of the model is that it is able to interpret both numerical and categorical data. The disadvantage of the model is that the decision tree has to be rebuilt for new data entry and also the model can easily be overfit. Decision trees may be useful for this problem, as our dataset contains both categorical and numerical data but caution should be used while implementing because due to the large amount of features the model can be overfit. \n",

When the accuracy score was compared between the three models, it was found that during training the accuracy score for SVC was the highest followed closely by Logistic Regression and then Naive Bayes. However, performance in the testing set was lower than logistic regression with around a 5% difference. Otherwise, the F-score during the training set was low for both SVC and logistic regression but in the testing set logistic regression performed the best out of all three models. Lastly, time taken during the training and testing phase for logistic regression can be considered almost negilible compared to Support Vector Machines. *"

By giving various machine learning algorithms a variety of characteristics, we will be able to determine which people are more likely to donate. \n",

    "To train our model, the dataset will be split so that a large portion goes to training and the leftover portion can be used to test how well the model works. A machine learning algorithm called Logistic Regression will be trained to use our training set to make future predictions. Logistic regression works by describing data by assigning weights to each feature and explains the relationship. The probability is found using a sigmoid function which uses our weighted features and tries to find a function that is minimal in errors. This becomes the model used to describe our dataset and will be used to predict whether an individual will make over 50 thousand per year. The model will then be compared with the test set leftover from splitting and a score of accuracy will be calculated which will be how much it predicted right and wrong can be calculated to see if the model is suitable.

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

While the accuracy score only decreases by 5%, the f=score decreases by around 16% and it would considered to be too much of a decrease for the amount of time decreased. Logistic regression also was relatively quick and accurate compared to the other algorithms considered for this exercise. *"
